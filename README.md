# MNIST GAN

A GAN that generates handwritten digits that was trained on the MNIST dataset. This is a bit of a step back from my DoGAN project, where it's much easier as its generating monochrome rather than 3 channel RGB images. Happy to say this generator works!

## The Discriminator

Bunch of CNN layers!

## The Generator

Bunch of Conv2D Transpose layers!
